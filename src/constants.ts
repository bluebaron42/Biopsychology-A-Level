export const lesson1DoNow = [
  { id: 1, question: 'What is the primary caregiver typically responsible for?', options: ['Physical care only', 'Emotional and physical needs', 'Education only'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Caregivers have responsibility for both the physical care (feeding, clothing, safety) and emotional needs (comfort, affection, security) of the child.' },
  { id: 2, question: 'What does "innate" mean in psychology?', options: ['Learned through experience', 'Present from birth', 'Developed in adolescence'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Innate means present or existing from birth. It refers to behaviors and abilities that are biological rather than learned through experience.' },
  { id: 3, question: 'What is a "bond" in the context of relationships?', options: ['A legal agreement', 'An emotional connection between people', 'A physical restraint'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! In psychology, a bond is an emotional connection that forms between individuals. In attachment, the bond between caregiver and infant is crucial for development.' },
  { id: 4, question: 'Which sense is most developed in newborn babies?', options: ['Vision', 'Hearing', 'Smell'], correct: 2, feedback: 'Correct! Newborns have the most developed sense of smell. They can recognize their mother by scent within hours of birth and use this to find food.' },
  { id: 5, question: 'What does "reciprocal" mean?', options: ['One-way interaction', 'Two-way mutual interaction', 'Delayed response'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Reciprocal means two-way or mutual. In attachment, reciprocal interaction refers to back-and-forth responses between caregiver and infant, like a conversation.' }

// Lesson 2 Do Now - tests Lesson 1 content
export const lesson2DoNow = [
  { id: 1, question: 'What is interactional synchrony?', options: ['Random infant movements', 'Coordinated caregiver-infant actions', 'Infant crying patterns'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Interactional synchrony is the coordinated timing of caregiver and infant behaviors, where the infant mirrors or matches the adult\'s actions and expressions.' },
  { id: 2, question: 'What did Meltzoff and Moore (1977) demonstrate?', options: ['Infant memory', 'Infant imitation of adult expressions', 'Infant language'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Meltzoff and Moore found that infants as young as 2-3 weeks could imitate adult facial expressions like tongue protrusion, showing that imitation is innate.' },
  { id: 3, question: 'What is reciprocity in attachment?', options: ['One-way communication', 'Turn-taking interaction between caregiver and infant', 'Infant sleep patterns'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Reciprocity in attachment refers to the turn-taking interaction between caregiver and infant, similar to a conversation where each partner responds to the other.' },
  { id: 4, question: 'At what age do infants begin to show interactional synchrony?', options: ['From birth', 'From 2 weeks', 'From 6 months'], correct: 0, feedback: 'Correct! Research shows that interactional synchrony is present from birth. Condon and Sander (1974) found newborns as young as 1-2 days old synchronize movements with adult speech.' },
  { id: 5, question: 'What is "motherese"?', options: ['A type of formula milk', 'High-pitched speech used with infants', 'A medical condition'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Motherese (also called infant-directed speech) is the high-pitched, exaggerated speech that caregivers naturally use with infants. It helps capture infant attention and aids language development.' }

Infant monkeys spent 17-18 hours per day with the cloth mother and only visited the wire mother briefly to feed, showing contact comfort is more important than food.' },
  { id: 3, question: 'What happened to Harlow\'s monkeys when they became mothers?', options: ['They were excellent parents', 'Many were neglectful or abusive', 'They showed normal parenting'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! The "motherless mothers" were often neglectful or abusive to their own offspring, demonstrating intergenerational effects of maternal deprivation.' },
  { id: 4, question: 'What is the main limitation of using animal studies to understand human attachment?', options: ['Animals don\'t form attachments', 'Difficulty generalising to more complex human behaviour', 'The studies are too old'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct!

  { id: 1, question: 'What is "cupboard love" in Learning Theory?', options: ['Love of kitchen furniture', 'Attachment forms because caregivers provide food', 'A type of secure attachment'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! "Cupboard love" refers to the Learning Theory idea that infants attach to caregivers because they associate them with the pleasure of being fed.' },
  { id: 2, question: 'What is monotropy in Bowlby\'s theory?', options: ['Having multiple equal attachments', 'Forming one special primary attachment', 'Attachment to objects only'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Monotropy is Bowlby\'s idea that infants form one primary attachment that is qualitatively different and more important than all other attachments.' },
  { id: 3, question: 'What is the Internal Working Model?', options: ['A physical model of the brain', 'A mental template for relationships based on early attachment', 'A type of conditioning'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! The IWM is a mental representation of the self, attachment figure, and relationships that forms during early attachment and influences all future relationships.' },
  { id: 4, question: 'What are social releasers according to Bowlby?', options: ['Parenting classes', 'Innate behaviours that trigger caregiving', 'Methods to reduce attachment'], correct: 1, feedback: 'Correct! Social releasers are innate behaviours like crying, smiling, and cooing that infants are born with to trigger caregiving responses from adults.' },
