Students should develop knowledge and understanding of research methods, practical research skills and maths skills through ethical practical research activities.


CHAPTER 6: RESEARCH METHODS IN PSYCHOLOGY
==========================================

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
-------------------

Key Terms:
- Experimental method: Involves the manipulation of an independent variable (IV) to measure the effect on the dependent variable (DV). Experiments may be laboratory, field, natural or quasi.
- Aim: A general statement of what the researcher intends to investigate, the purpose of the study.
- Hypothesis: A clear, precise, testable statement that states the relationship between the variables to be investigated. Stated at the outset of any study.
- Directional hypothesis: States the direction of the difference or relationship.
- Non-directional hypothesis: Does not state the direction of the difference or relationship.

Variables:
- Variables: Any "thing" that can vary or change within an investigation. Variables are generally used in experiments to determine if changes in one thing result in changes to another.
- Independent variable (IV): Some aspect of the experimental situation that is manipulated by the researcher - or changes naturally - so the effect on the DV can be measured.
- Dependent variable (DV): The variable that is measured by the researcher. Any effect on the DV should be caused by the change in the IV.
- Operationalisation: Clearly defining variables in terms of how they can be measured.

Writing Hypotheses:
When you read your hypothesis back to yourself, make sure:
1. The IV and DV are clear and measurable
2. You have stated the relationship between the IV and DV and not stated an aim
3. You have selected the appropriate hypothesis (directional or non-directional) based on the information given

Directional vs Non-directional:
- Sometimes the terms "two-tailed" and "one-tailed" are used when describing a hypothesis instead of "non-directional" and "directional"
- A directional hypothesis requires a two-tailed test of significance

Example hypothesis progression:
Poor hypothesis: "Drinking an energy drink makes people more chatty"
Better hypothesis (operationalised): "After drinking 300ml of SpeedUpp, participants say more words in the next five minutes than participants who drink 300ml of water"


RESEARCH ISSUES
---------------

Investigator Effects:
- Participant reactivity leads to investigator effects
- Researchers may unknowingly encourage certain behaviors through unconscious behavior
- During recording, researchers may smile more or interact differently with certain participants
- Can influence the DV through researcher bias in design decisions

Demand Characteristics:
- Participants may second guess the aims of the study
- May alter their behavior accordingly
- Can compromise the validity of results

Controlling Variables:
- Extraneous variables: Nuisance variables but randomly distributed
- Confounding variables: Vary systematically with IV
- Need to control everything that could cause findings to be due to anything other than what was intended


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS
--------------------

1. Independent Groups:
   - Participants in each condition of experiment are different
   - Evaluation:
     * Participant variables not controlled (use random allocation)
     * Less economical
     * No order effects

2. Repeated Measures:
   - All participants take part in all conditions
   - Evaluation:
     * Order effects (use counterbalancing)
     * Demand characteristics possible
     * Participant variables controlled
     * More economical

3. Matched Pairs:
   - Similar participants paired on participant variables
   - Allocated to condition A or B
   - Evaluation:
     * No order effects
     * Cannot match participants exactly
     * Time-consuming


RESEARCH TECHNIQUES
-------------------

Pilot Studies:
- Check procedures and techniques
- Make changes before main study
- Remove/reword questions that are too complex, leading, or double-barrelled
- Test if there are any problems with procedures

Single-blind:
- Participants aren't aware of aims/conditions until end
- Reduces demand characteristics

Double-blind:
- Neither participants nor individual conducting research know the aim/condition
- Further reduces bias and demand characteristics

Randomisation:
- Chance methods to reduce researcher's bias
- Random allocation to conditions

Standardisation:
- Ensuring all participants have the same experience
- Controls for extraneous variables


TYPES OF EXPERIMENTS
--------------------

Laboratory Experiments:
- Controlled environment
- Evaluation:
  * High internal validity (control)
  * Low external validity (artificiality)
  * Demand characteristics

Field Experiments:
- Natural environment
- Evaluation:
  * Higher external validity (more authentic, realism)
  * Lower internal validity (less control)
  * Ethical issues (consent not always possible)

Natural Experiments:
- IV varies naturally (not manipulated by researcher)
- Only option for practical/ethical reasons
- Evaluation:
  * High external validity (real-world problems)
  * Limited opportunities
  * No random allocation (confounding variables)
  * Low realism if in a lab
  * No manipulation of IV (can't claim cause and effect)

Quasi-experiments:
- IV based on pre-existing difference between people (e.g., age, gender)
- Evaluation:
  * If in a lab, issues as for lab experiment
  * No random allocation
  * No manipulation of IV (can't claim cause and effect)


CONTROL GROUPS AND CONDITIONS
------------------------------
- Used as a comparison or baseline
- Levels of the IV: Experimental and control conditions


OBSERVATIONAL METHODS
---------------------

Key Terms:
- Naturalistic observation: Watching and recording behaviour in the setting within which it would normally occur.
- Controlled observation: Watching and recording behaviour within a structured environment, i.e. one where some variables are managed.
- Covert observation: Participants' behaviour is watched and recorded without their knowledge or consent.
- Overt observation: Participants' behaviour is watched and recorded with their knowledge and consent.
- Participant observation: The researcher becomes a member of the group whose behaviour he/she is watching and recording.
- Non-participant observation: The researcher remains outside of the group whose behaviour he/she is watching and recording.

Types of Observation:

Naturalistic vs Controlled:
- Naturalistic: Take place in the setting where target behaviour would usually occur. All aspects of environment free to vary.
- Controlled: Some control over environment, e.g. manipulation of variables

Evaluation of Naturalistic Observations:
- Low internal validity (control difficult)
- High external validity (everyday life)

Evaluation of Controlled Observations:
- High internal validity - extraneous variables may be controlled
- Low external validity (except if covert)

Covert vs Overt:
- Covert: Low demand characteristics but ethically questionable
- Overt: Behaviour may be affected by knowledge of being observed

Participant vs Non-participant:
- Participant: Increased external validity but may lose objectivity
- Non-participant: More objectivity (increased internal validity), less insight

General Evaluation of All Observations:
- Capture what people do (rather than self-report)
- Observer bias possible
- No causal relationships shown


OBSERVATIONAL DESIGN
--------------------

Ways of Recording Data:
- Record everything (unstructured)
- Use categories (structured)

Behavioural Categories:
- Target behaviours broken down into observable components
- Must be:
  * Observable
  * Avoid "dustbin category"
  * No overlap between categories

Sampling Methods:

1. Continuous Recording:
   - Record all instances of behavior

2. Event Sampling:
   - Count events
   - Useful for infrequent behaviour
   - May miss complexity

3. Time Sampling:
   - A target individual or group is first established
   - Researcher records their behaviour in a fixed time frame (e.g., every 60 seconds)
   - Less effort but may not represent whole behaviour

Evaluation of Observational Design:

Structured vs Unstructured:
- Structured: Numerical data, easier to analyse
- Unstructured: May just be eye-catching information, qualitative data harder to analyse
- Observer bias possible in both


SELF-REPORT TECHNIQUES
----------------------

Key Terms:
- Self-report technique: Any method in which a person is asked to state or explain their own feelings, opinions, behaviours and/or experiences related to a given topic.
- Questionnaire: A set of written questions (sometimes referred to as "items") used to assess a person's thoughts and/or experiences.
- Interview: A "live" encounter (face-to-face or on the phone) where one person (the interviewer) asks a set of questions to assess an interviewee's thoughts and/or experiences.

QUESTIONNAIRES
--------------

Types of Questions:

1. Closed Questions:
   - Fixed-choice options
   - Likert scale (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree)
   - Rating scale (e.g., 1-10)
   - Produce quantitative data
   - Easy to analyse
   - May lack depth

2. Open Questions:
   - Participants can express freely
   - Produce qualitative data
   - Difficult to collate and summarise data
   - Provides rich, detailed information

Design Considerations:
- Avoid leading questions
- Avoid double-barrelled questions (asking two things at once)
- Avoid complex language
- Ensure questions are not ambiguous
- Pilot test the questionnaire

INTERVIEWS
----------

Types of Interviews:

1. Structured Interviews:
   - Pre-set questions read out to participants
   - Questions asked in same order
   - Like a questionnaire but face-to-face

2. Semi-structured Interviews:
   - Some pre-set questions
   - Flexibility to ask follow-up questions

3. Unstructured Interviews:
   - Questions develop as interview goes along
   - Like a conversation
   - More flexible but harder to replicate

Evaluation of Self-Report Methods:
- Direct way of understanding why people behave as they do
- Social desirability bias possible
- May lack honesty
- Memory issues


CORRELATIONS
------------

Key Terms:
- Correlation: A mathematical technique in which a researcher investigates an association between two variables, called co-variables.
- Co-variables: The variables investigated within a correlation (e.g., height and weight). Not referred to as IV and DV because correlation investigates association rather than cause-and-effect.
- Positive correlation: As one co-variable increases so does the other.
- Negative correlation: As one co-variable increases the other decreases.
- Zero correlation: No relationship between co-variables.

Differences from Experiments:
- Correlation examines relationships between variables
- Experiments manipulate variables to show cause and effect
- Correlations cannot establish causation

Correlational Hypotheses:
- Can be directional or non-directional
- Directional example: "There is a positive correlation between the price of a chocolate bar and its tastiness rating"
- Non-directional example: "There is a correlation between the price of a chocolate bar and its tastiness rating"

Evaluation:

Strengths:
- Useful preliminary tool for research
- Provide precise and quantifiable measure of how two variables are related
- May suggest ideas for possible future research
- Often used as starting point before committing to experimental study
- Relatively quick and economical to carry out
- No need for controlled environment
- No manipulation of variables required
- Can use secondary data (e.g., government statistics)
- Less time-consuming than experiments

Limitations:
- Cannot establish cause and effect
- Third variable problem (other variables may be involved)
- Correlation does not equal causation


TYPES OF DATA
-------------

Qualitative Data:
- Data expressed in words and non-numerical
- May be converted to numbers for analysis
- Rich, detailed information
- Harder to analyse and summarise

Quantitative Data:
- Data that can be counted, usually given as numbers
- Easy to analyse statistically
- May lack depth and detail

Primary Data:
- Information obtained first-hand by researcher for purposes of research project
- Gathered directly from participants (experiments, self-report, observations)
- Fits research aims exactly
- Time and effort required to collect

Secondary Data:
- Information that has already been collected by someone else
- Pre-dates the current research project
- May include work of other psychologists or government statistics
- Quick and inexpensive
- May not fit research aims exactly
- May be outdated or incomplete
- Quality and accuracy may vary

META-ANALYSIS
-------------
- Process of combining findings from a number of studies on a particular topic
- Aim is to produce overall statistical conclusion (effect size) based on range of studies
- Should not be confused with a review where studies are compared and discussed

Process:
- Identify studies that have investigated the same aims/hypothesis
- Results pooled together
- Joint conclusion produced
- If IV measured in same way, can perform statistical analysis
- Calculate effect size (dependent variable of meta-analysis)

Evaluation:

Strengths:
- Creates larger, more varied sample
- Results can be generalised across larger populations
- Increases validity

Limitations:
- Prone to publication bias (file drawer problem)
- Researcher may not select all relevant studies
- May choose to leave out studies with negative or non-significant results
- Conclusions may be biased


ETHICAL ISSUES
--------------
Ethical issues apply to all different research methods used in Psychology - not just experiments.

Key ethical considerations:
- Informed consent
- Deception
- Debriefing
- Right to withdraw
- Confidentiality
- Protection from harm
- Privacy


SCIENTIFIC PROCESS
------------------

Step 1: Identify a research question or issue
- Usually stems from observing interesting behaviour
- Or from broader psychological theory

Step 2: Decide on a topic to study (your aim)
- Observations lead you to decide on topic
- Make formal statement - a hypothesis
- Statement of what you believe is true
- Can test to see if supported by evidence

Step 3: Design a study to test your hypothesis
- Key feature of science is that it is controlled
- Many different kinds of study possible
- Controlled experiment allows comparison between groups

Step 4: Carry out the study
- Take account of ethical issues
- Follow standardised procedures

Step 5: Analyse results
- Use appropriate statistical tests
- Determine if results are significant

Step 6: Draw conclusions
- Relate findings back to hypothesis
- Consider implications
- Identify limitations
- Suggest future research


VALIDITY
--------

Internal Validity:
- Whether the IV caused the change in DV
- Control over extraneous variables
- Reduced by confounding variables, demand characteristics, investigator effects

External Validity:
- Concerned with things outside research study
- To what extent can findings be generalised to other situations?
- Ecological validity: Can findings be generalised to everyday life?
- Population validity: Can findings be generalised to other populations?
- Historical validity: Can findings be generalised across time?


RELIABILITY
-----------
